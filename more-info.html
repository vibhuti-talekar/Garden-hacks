          A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the
          family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred
          species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form
          a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing,
          with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.
          Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in
          colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are
          native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America,
          and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and
          hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.
          Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose
          plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that
          can reach seven meters in height. Different species
          hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the
          wide range of garden roses.
